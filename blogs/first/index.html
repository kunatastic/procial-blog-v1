        <h2 class="title">the lost library of John Dee</h2>
        <h6 class="subtitle">November 25, 2015</h6>

        <p>
          John Dee (1527–1609) is one of the most intriguing characters of 16th
          century England. A member of the Elizabethan court, he is infamous for
          his attempts to make contact with other-worldly spirits and his study
          and practice of alchemy. He was also a mathematician and scholar of
          navigation, a founding fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, a
          university lecturer on rhetoric, and an astrologer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dee’s library was one of the most famous collections of books and
          manuscripts of its time, as renowned for its contents as for the fact
          it was pillaged and dispersed while Dee was travelling in Europe
          during the 1580s.

          Today the Royal College of Physicians library contains more than 100
          books previously belonging to Dee: the largest known collection of Dee
          books surviving in one location. They were acquired as part of the
          library of the Marquis of Dorchester, presented to the physicians in
          the 1680s. It is not clear how these 100-plus volumes came to be owned
          by Dorchester, but there is evidence that many of them were stolen
          from Dee by a certain Nicholas Saunder.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Dee collection contains some of the most dramatic and beautiful
          books in the RCP library, including mathematical, astronomical and
          alchemical texts. Many of the books are heavily and elaborately
          annotated by Dee himself.
